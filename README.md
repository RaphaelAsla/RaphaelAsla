### EXperience
Grand architect of undefined `C++` template metaprogramming recursion, optimizing compile-time existential crises into `constexpr` singularities.
Pioneer of Vim keybinding reductionism, condensing the known universe into a `.vimrc` with fewer than 10 lines.
Lead implementer of GPU-bound fragment chaos, specializing in out-of-bounds UV sampling and recursive shader compilation deadlocks.

### Currently Learning
- Quantum-aligned `std::optional` dereferencing (Schrödinger’s value)
- Investigating why `std::unique_ptr` feels less unique under heavy multithreading
- Using tmux panes to simulate higher-dimensional spaces
- Memory-aligned pointerless pointer architectures
- Fast inverse spaghetti transform
