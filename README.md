### EXperience
Grand architect of undefined C++ template metaprogramming recursion, optimizing
compile-time existential crises into constexpr singularities. Pioneer of Vim
keybinding reductionism, condensing the known universe into a .vimrc with fewer
than 42 lines. Lead implementer of GPU-bound fragment chaos, specializing in
out-of-bounds UV sampling and recursive shader compilation deadlocks.

### Currently Learning
- Memory-aligned pointerless pointer architectures (because why have pointers when you can have belief)
- GPU-driver-specific hacks that only work on odd-numbered Tuesdays
- Tiling window manager feng shui as applied to tmux pane symmetry
- Practical applications of undefined behavior in multi-threaded draw call orchestration
- Writing Vulkan wrappers that wrap nothing but existential dread
- Integrating nvim-cpp-mode with quantum entanglement-based syntax highlighting
- Catmull-Clark subdivision of ASCII art models
